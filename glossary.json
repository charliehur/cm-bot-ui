On earth we usually treat these as the same thing… but on Mars astronauts must get used to the difference. A 45kg rock (about the same as that 100 lb) will feel like a 17kg rock to lift or hold, but will be as hard to throw as it would be on Earth… and hit as hard. New colonists will need to be very careful or misjudging effort caused by this effect may cause serious accidents. \n\n## The Planet\n\nMars’ lower gravity has shaped the planet in many ways. The combination of having heavy elements and reduced gravity makes Mars home to Mt. Olympus, the tallest mountain in the solar system, towering almost 22 km above the plain. During dust storms, particles of dust reach far higher into the atmosphere than they would on earth.\n\n## Engineering and Construction\n\nThe low gravity makes certain kinds of engineering challenges easier. It requires far less energy to launch a rocket from Mars, for example; many people believe we could build a space elevator there using current materials and technologies. \n\nStructures are also easier to design as loads from gravity will be much less. Eventually Martian architecture should be spectacular!\n\n[Explore Made for Mars Buildings -> ](#)\n\n## Human Physiology\n\nThe lower gravity of Mars does present problems for human physiology. Our bodies evolved under the weight of Earth’s gravity. On Mars, we may find it difficult to retain bone density, and there are some concerns about embryo development on Mars. Our hearts were designed to pump blood to the head against gravity’s pull. In space, some astronauts have reported symptoms related to the increased pressure of blood in the head, such as eye problems and headaches. \n\nWhile a few astronauts have spent a year or more in the microgravity of the International Space Station, nobody has yet spent a long time in a place like Mars, where gravity is lower than earth but still very perceptible. We do not yet know what long term effects this will have on the body… perhaps we will need to be as vigilant as astronauts in micro-gravity (requiring a lot of exercise and still having cumulative damaging effects.) Or perhaps our bodies will adapt and learn to ‘hold the line’ against bone loss and other problems even with less than normal Earth gravity. This is something that early colonists will have to learn. It does seem likely that exercise to compensate for the lower gravity will be an important part of every astronaut’s routine.",

On earth soil is made largely of organic material and contains high amounts of water, but on Mars it is made almost entirely of various sizes of very jagged particles of rock, from fairly large to very small (see [Environmental Hazards](/mars/the-planet/environmental-hazards))\n\nThe regolith (and especially the dust) presents challenges, but it is also a resource. Regolith can be mined for many minerals and important elements. Mixed with sulfur or plastic resin it also makes [marscrete](/technology/manufactured-resources/marscrete), a substitute for concrete that will be an important building material for the colony.\n\nSurface regolith contains a mixture of different minerals, with some variation from place to place. Here is a breakdown from some of the Mars probes that have [analyzed the regolith](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia16572-inspecting-soils-across-mars):\n\nOf particular interest are silica (SiO2) used for making glass, sulfates (SO3) from which we may extract sulfur) and some of the oxides which can be refined to extract metals (though this takes a lot of energy).\n\nThe past action of water and ongoing action by wind means that dunes can sort the particles of regolith by size or density, and some exploration may help to identify areas with the best characteristics for various purposes.\n\n### Information to Note:\n\n- Due to the lower gravity on Mars, sand dunes and similar features will have coarser particles than their Earth equivalents\n\n- The bombardment of the surface by high energy particles from the sun and deep space means that the top of the regolith has significant amounts of radioactivity.\n\n- The regolith has significant levels of perchlorate compounds which are rare on Earth. These are toxic and care must be taken in processing this material.\n",

Each sol takes 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds - about 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth.\n\nBecause Mars takes longer to go around the Sun than earth, its year is longer, too. There are 669.6 sols in a Martian year - about 687 Earth days.\n\nOn Earth, each of our four seasons lasts about the same length of time, but because of Mars’ egg-shaped orbit around the sun, the seasons there are different. Usually we describe Mars's position in its orbit using the *Solar Latitude (LS)* - basically measuring how many degrees around its orbit Mars has traveled. The Martian year starts at the spring equinox (0॰ LS). The summer solstice is at 90॰ LS, and so on.\n\nThe year can be divided into 12 “months” based on LS if desired, but these values do not map onto days in a simple way because **the speed at which Mars orbits changes.** The seasons are equally divided in terms of LS but not in terms of sols!\n\nSo there are several different ways to describe what time it is on Mars.\nFor example, mission 4 arrived at Mars on 25 Jan 2038, which was year 45, Sol 13 on Mars, or alternatively year 45, sol 13 of month 1, or year 45, LS 6.4°\n\nBecause the martian year is so long there are various proposals for dividing it into “months”, usually based on LS, ie 0-30°, 30-60°, and so on for 12 “Martian Months” (used above). Others have proposed longer time spans, such as six pseudo-seasons or “sextons” (named “Unober”, “Duober”, “Triober”, “Quartober”, “Quintober”, and “Sixtober”, respectively… so the Mission 4 arrival was also the 46th of Unober, y45). \n\nUltimately it will be interesting to see how colonists themselves choose to describe the time and seasons on Mars.\n\nA resource for converting from Earth time to Martian Solar Longitude and sols is at: \n- [Convert Earth to Mars Time](http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/mars/time/martian_time.html)\n- [Convert Mars to Earth Time](http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/mars/time/mars_date_to_earth_date.html)\n\n## Seasons \n\nFor now we will use the 4 “traditional” season divisions based on the equinoxes and solstices. This gives the following seasons with their different lengths: \n\n| Northern | Southern | Sol Latitude (LS) | ~ Duration |\n| - | :- | -: | :-: |\n| Spring | Autumn | 0 - 90॰ LS | 194 days |\n| Summer\tWinter | 90-180॰ LS | 178 days | \n| Autumn | Spring | 180-270॰ LS | 142 days | \n| Winter | Summer | 270-360॰ LS | 154 days | \n\nThese seasons affect temperatures and light levels. Most major, large-scale, dust storms occur in Northern fall and winter (Southern spring and summer), though local dust storms can occur at any time. See also [Climate and Weather](#)\n\n### Calendar \n\nCurrent convention starts the Martian calendar at the equinox that took place on April 11, 1955. Each new martian year begins with the vernal equinox (LS = 0॰)\n\n### Event\nEarth Date\t\t\tMars Date\nCuriosity mission landing\t\t2012, Aug 6\t\t\t31, sol 319\nPerseverance mission landing\t2021, Feb 18\t\t\t36, sol 11\nColonize Mars, Mission One\nColonize Mars, Mission Two\nColonize Mars, Mission Three\nColonize Mars, Mission Four",

On Earth we are protected to a large degree by the planet’s magnetic field and by the planet’s thick atmosphere. Neither of these is the case for Mars. Protecting themselves from radiation will therefore be an important consideration for Martian colonists.\n\n## Measuring Radiation\nMeasuring how much radiation is present in an environment can be somewhat confusing, because we can mean different things if we ask “how much radiation is there?” \n\nIn particular we may mean:\n\n### How many particles are present?\t\nMeasured in particles/decays per second (becquerels, Bq)\nThis is a simple count of how many particles are created, for example when a radioactive substance decays. It is a basic amount, like describing how many kg of food you ate at breakfast.\n\n### How much of the radiation is absorbed by us? (the dose)\t\nMeasured in J/kg grey (Gy) for total radiation absorbed, or Gy/s for a rate.\nThis tells us how much energy has been deposited by the radiation, somewhat like describing how many calories or kJ of food a meal contains, which is more relevant than just the amount.\n\n### How much impact does the radiation absorbed have on us? (the dose equivalent)\nMeasured in sieverts (Sv), or more often millisieverts (mSv)\nThis adjusts the dose based on how damaging the particular type of radiation is to the human body. For the purposes of astronauts this is the most important measure. It is a bit like measures such as the glycemic index for food, which consider not just the energy but how it impacts the body.\n\n### How Much Radiation is There on Mars?\nWithout the natural protection we have on Earth, astronauts will be exposed to much higher levels of radiation day-to-day. The day-to-day amount of radiation encountered is called the background radiation. \n\nOn Earth it is rare for a person to be exposed to more than 5 mSv a year (often less than 2 mSv). \n\nOn Mars the dose equivalent will be much higher, from 300 to 500 mSv a year, depending on location. On Mars the dose equivalent will be much higher, from 300 to 500 mSv a year, depending on location [(Mars's Surface Radiation Environment Measured with the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity Rover, D. M. Hassler et al. Science 434 (2014)).](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1244797.full.html)\n\n\nThis radiation will come from **cosmic rays** (sources of very high energy particles, many outside our galaxy) and from the **Sun **(which throws off high energy electrons and protons, often called the solar wind, and occasionally bursts of higher energy particles). \n\n### Radioactive ground\nThe surface of Mars is actually the most radioactive part of the planet, as radiation is absorbed by dust and rocks and then re-emitted. The planet’s radioactive “skin” is very thin - being even one meter underground provides excellent protection. But buildings which sit above the ground will need radiation shielding in the floors just as much as the roof.\n\n## How Much Radiation is Too Much?\nThere is significant debate as to the effects of these levels of radiation. Some places on Earth have levels over 200 mSv/y and people have lived there without evident bad effects for thousands of years. On the other hand, many people believe any level of radiation is potentially harmful.\n\nCertainly precautions will be needed, and some events, such as Solar Storms, will require special measures. ",

On Earth oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere thanks to plants and algae, but on Mars there is almost no free oxygen. The colonists will have to extract it.\n\n[Astronauts on the ISS used 0.84 kg of oxygen each per day. ](https://www.cnet.com/science/breathe-deep-how-the-iss-keeps-astronauts-alive/) Of course, astronauts on Mars Colony will be moving around more and working harder than those on the ISS. Let’s assume they will need 1 kg of oxygen per day. How will we make it?\n\nDetails and calculations for each method, as well as the oxygen produced by various equipment on Mars, can be found in Making Oxygen\n## Greenhouses\nPlants are sources of both food and oxygen, consuming carbon dioxide (produced by astronauts or harvested from the atmosphere) and sunlight and producing oxygen and food. \n\nGreenhouses can meet some of the oxygen needs of the colony, but they have a couple of disadvantages, too. They use more water to produce the same amount of oxygen as processes such as electrolysis (next section) and they are also fragile. Plant diseases or accidents could damage or destroy crops. Dust storms can reduce light to the point that maintaining the plants becomes difficult. Since oxygen is not optional we need to be sure we have other sources. \n## Electrolyzing Water\nWater is H2O, hydrogen monoxide. It contains oxygen which can be extracted using electrolysis (running an electric current through  H2O to break the bonds between hydrogen and oxygen.\n\n### Fuel Production\nOxygen is also produced in the fuel plant while creating methane. Using methane as fuel requires oxygen as well. However, for best efficiency the rocket actually uses slightly less oxygen than one would expect from the chemistry alone (3.5 kg O2 / 1.0 kg of methane, not 4.0kg as complete combustion would require), so there is an excess of 0.5 kg of spare oxygen per kg of fuel produced.\n## Perchlorates\nAlthough nasty, perchlorates are also potentially quite useful. In particular there are bacteria that reduce perchlorates as their source of energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n\t\t\n\n> ClO4-  → Cl- + 2 O2\n\nSuch bacteria can serve to both purify water or soil contaminated by perchlorates, and to produce oxygen! This process does not require any additional energy beyond maintaining the bacteria, which can also become a source of biomass.\n\n## Refining\nRefining of minerals often produces oxygen as a byproduct. On Earth this would be vented, but on Mars we will definitely want to reclaim it. \n\n\n",

Over time, however, Mars lost most of its atmosphere. Because the atmospheric pressure on Mars is so low, water on the surface will boil at -4.96 Celsius and when it does, the gravity is so low it tends to escape into space. \n\nScientists estimate[ the last freely running water on the surface of Mars dried up 2 billion years ago](https://www.planetary.org/articles/your-guide-to-water-on-mars#:~:text=Mars%20is%20rich%20in%20minerals,European%20Space%20Agency's%20Mars%20Express). As a result, the water that remains on Mars is almost entirely in the form of subsurface ice deposits.\n\nWe now believe [Mars has more than 5 million cubic kilometers of ice at or near the surface](https://marsed.asu.edu/mep/ice). Most of this water is near the poles, but not all of it, and there are likely to be other significant deposits further underground.\n\n## Geological Impacts\nAncient water systems have left many marks on Mars, from river channels to ancient lake beds. Mars has many minerals formed in water; some even retain water inside them. One excellent place to look for mineral resources are ancient streams or river beds which have been subsequently capped by volcanic lava flows, providing a rich mix of minerals and heavy metals from the planet’s core.\n\n## Human Use\nAny human colony on Mars will rely on ice mining rigs to supply water for drinking and food production, oxygen (through hydrolysis) and rocket fuel produced using water and CO2 from the atmosphere. \n\nFinding good and reliable sources of water will be a priority for the astronauts. Surveys from orbit can identify places which have significant water, but not what form that water is in or how easily it can be recovered.\n\nSee Making Water for a more detailed explanation of how water is manufactured on Mars.\n\n",

It is a vital connection between the colony and the rest of humanity.\n\nMost communication flows through a communications satellite in stationary orbit. [Fun fact: on earth we would call this a Geosynchronous satellite, with “Geo” referencing Earth, but our satellite is Aerosynchronous, meaning “stationary relative to Mars.”] \n\nThis satellite is closer to the surface of Mars than a geosynchronous one is to Earth, making communication easier.\n\nPower is needed to provide ongoing communication and data transmission between Mars, Earth and the various satellites and ships in between.\n\nScientists are needed to ensure that information is being recorded and shared properly, to adjust the antenna, and to determine when and how the orbits of satellites must be adjusted.\n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"communication_array\"  keys=\"ca-B,ca-C,ca-A\"></ItemInGame>",

The lack of water combined with the very thin atmosphere means that temperature and pressure change greatly from season to season and from day to night. \n\nFor example, here is a plot of the high and low daily temperature recorded by the Curiosity rover over three Martian years. Note that dates are in LS (see the section on [seasons ](/mars/the-planet/days-years-and-seasons)for more info):\n\n <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/Climate_Weather_Graph_fe79aa9659.png\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAECAIAAAA4WjmaAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAh0lEQVR4nAF8AIP/ANzW1qGDg7Scm56CgXVRUS0AADsHCm9FRW9FRZF2dgCroqMqCRA4GR8kAAAvERlWRkxXR0yEeYBwXmNfSEsAztXYgKOyY4maZ42faJCgYoiaaI2eepakgqKxn7S9APb29vn39vv69/v69/n39vf29fz7+/z7+v///uXk5BcpQ/K2LmJtAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\"></ImageWithBlur> \n\nIt is worth noting that Curiosity was very close to the equator, so this is tropical weather on Mars. Notice that just as the temperature on Earth can change significantly from today to tomorrow, and be quite different from what it was the same time last year, so too the temperature on Mars shows significant variation. This means that predicting the exact weather will be an inexact process, just as on Earth. \n\n## Pressure and Wind\nMars once had a much thicker atmosphere, but because of its low gravity most of it has escaped into space. What remains would count as a vacuum on Earth, but it still is enough to have significant effects, especially as it interacts with the surface in dust storms, which can blot out the sun for months, as well as cause erosion and movement of significant amounts of material.\n \nAnother significant difference from Earth is that the Martian atmosphere itself is highly changeable. On earth the atmospheric pressure seldom changes by more than a few percent, but on Mars it can fluctuate seasonally by 30% or more. This is because during the winter (esp. the southern winter) a significant percentage of the atmosphere freezes as CO2 ice at the poles. Here, again, is a graph of observations from Curiosity to show this variation in real data:\n\n <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/Climate_Weather_Graph_2_84961edea3.png\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAADCAIAAAAlXwkiAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAZklEQVR4nGNYsGDhps1bFixY+PTpk/a2tqKiok2bt8yeM3f/vgMdHR0MJSWlmzZvmTN3/py580+dPr1p85ZNm7fs2LFzztz5BYVFDLGxsRXl5cnJyZFR0UbGxp4enkVFRRBBK0tLAPYKMOZpx9DvAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\"></ImageWithBlur> \n\nNotice that the pressure drops greatly in the southern winter (from LS=90° to 180°) and northern winter (from 270° to 360°).\n\n## Wind and dust storms:\nWind on Mars is not itself destructive… the atmosphere is so thin that it can exert little force, and even extreme wind speeds seldom exceed 100 m/s. But as mentioned before, even though it is thin the wind can interact with the dust causing significant effects.\n\nAlthough the wind exerts little pressure, rapidly moving dust and sand can effectively “sandblast” surfaces, causing erosion and potentially damaging equipment. It can also rearrange the terrain, burying some features (and equipment) or uncovering others. \n\nVarious places on Mars have prevailing winds, just as places on Earth do, and patterns of wind during the day. Local gusts of wind and swirls of wind and dust (“dust devils”) are often observed, and occasionally winds will become much more intense.\n\nHigh winds on Mars create dust storms where the motion of the atmosphere raises huge clouds of dust into the atmosphere. Local dust storms can last for only days, but sometimes smaller storms combine to create huge, planet-wide dust storms which can last many months. Such large-scale storms appear to almost always occur in the southern summer / northern winter, and although large storms are fairly regular yearly events in the southern hemisphere, they seem to expand into the planet-scale ones only about every 3 Martian years.\n\nThese storms put a lot of fine dust into the atmosphere, which is potentially damaging to people and equipment. Perhaps most significant of all, this dust blocks out most of the sunlight (60 to 80%, more during peak intensity). This drastically affects solar power, and can last for many months.\n\nLearn more about dust storms [here](/mars/the-planet/environmental-hazards).\n",

On earth the basic atmospheric pressure is about 101 thousand pascals (101 kPa). On Mars it seldom gets as high as 1000 pascals even in deep valleys, and is usually closer to 700. \n\nAn interesting thing to note here is that the amount of atmosphere on Mars varies seasonally, because in the winter (especially the southern winter) a significant amount of the CO2 in the atmosphere freezes out at the poles!\n\nBy volume, the Martian atmosphere is made up of about 95% carbon dioxide (CO2), 2.6% molecular nitrogen (N2), 1.9% argon (Ar), 0.16% molecular oxygen (O2), and 0.06% carbon monoxide (CO), though these percentages vary seasonally as well.\n\n## Temperature Effects\nThe thin atmosphere means that heat from the Sun easily escapes the planet.\n\nIf you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius). ([Source](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/#otp_atmosphere))\n\nBecause the atmospheric pressure is so low on the surface of Mars, water will boil at -4.96 degrees Celsius. This makes liquid water extremely rare - as soon as it is warm enough for ice to melt, it will turn to gas, not liquid.\n\nConversely, carbon dioxide will freeze at -78.5 C., a fairly common temperature on Mars. When it is this cold, atmospheric CO2 will be deposited as frost. It doesn’t crystallize in the same “snowflake” patterns as water, but forms rectangular crystals more similar to salt. Clouds on Mars can contain water ice and/or CO2 ice. (It is possible this may cause some spectacular optical effects the colonists will occasionally see, more complex equivalents of sun-dogs and halos!)\n\nThe thin atmosphere and lack of liquid water also means that the surface loses heat very quickly. The nighttime temperature can easily be more than 100°C lower than the daytime.\n\n## Wind and Dust\nThe thin atmosphere means that even a major [dust storm](/mars/the-planet/environmental-hazards) will not exert much force on objects or topple spaceships (despite The Martian). However this does not mean that dust storms are not an issue.\nAlthough the air itself exerts little force, the dust in the air is moving at high velocities and can ‘sand blast’ objects and cause significant erosion. It also moves sand and dust around, rearranging the landscape and potentially burying roads or equipment.\n\nBecause of the thin atmosphere and lack of water, static also builds up on dust and objects, and dust will stick to things in the worst “static cling” ever. This will make keeping things clean and dust out of moving parts (and habitats) a challenge - but an important one to overcome.\n",

				"content": "Mars will kill you if you let your guard down. Humans were not built for this environment, and astronauts need to be vigilant at all times. \n### Cold\nTemperatures on Mars vary wildly, reaching extreme cold temperatures of as low as -150 °C (at night at the poles) and as high as +20 °C (on the hottest part of a summer day on the equator). Average temperature on Mars is estimated at about -65 °C (average temperature for the Earth is about +15 °C).\n\nThe colony’s location is fairly tropical (about 12° South of the equator) and so comparatively warm. That still means an average temperature of about -50 °C, with lows below -60 and highs seldom going above 0 °C. \n\nAt the low end of this temperature range, material properties become different: rubber becomes like glass, metals are brittle, and lubricants don’t lubricate. During cold snaps bad things can happen:\n\n- Cracking or breaking of pipes or structures\n- Mechanical failures due to expansion and contraction\n- Mechanical failures due to seizing and wear\n- Battery output may drop to critical levels\n- Frostbite or worse if people are caught outside by any of these failures\n\nCold is the major issue with temperature, but warmth can be a problem, too. In areas where construction or mining has disturbed the surface, for example, a warm day can make ice in the soil vaporize and create sinkholes or dangerous instabilities. The sides of craters on Mars often show collapse due to this effect.\n\n### Dust\n\nInsight lander, at start and end of mission. The lander was eventually disabled by dust.\n\nThe dust on Mars is powdery, jagged and abrasive, corrosive and loaded with poisonous perchlorates. It also carries electrostatic charge, so it clings to everything. Keeping dust out of machinery and people will be a major headache for the astronauts and a core consideration when designing buildings, vehicles, and tools.\n\nFor example, there will be some kind of shower in every airlock where people can pass into a building from the outside world. You will enter the lock from outside, shower in your space suit to remove dust, remove the space suit and leave it in the airlock, then proceed into the habitat. Something similar will have to be figured out for vehicles, or they will have to be kept in sealed environments, with their own airlocks and showers… Cleaning dust contamination will be a regular and essential chore.\n\nWhen dust gets into/onto equipment it will: \n\n- Destroy moving parts by abrasion\n- Destroy parts by corrosion/oxidation\n- Obscure visibility on windows and ruin air-tight seals on doors\n\n\nWhen dust gets into people they will develop \nIrritation and sores,\ncoughs (and eventually tumors) from particles in the lungs\nThyroid poisoning\n\nAnd did we mention that the dust is radioactive? \n\n### Perchlorates\nPerchlorates are chlorine compounds such as magnesium perchlorate, Mg(ClO4)2, and sodium perchlorate (NaClO4). They are what make the dust poisonous. On earth soil is considered contaminated and unsafe if the perchlorate concentration exceeds 55 thousandths of a gram per kg of soil (for residential areas). The ground on Mars is about 0.5 to 1 gram perchlorate per kg. That’s 10 or 20 times what is safe.\n\nThis is bad. Perchlorates are toxic (they mess up your thyroid gland) and corrosive (so they will eat away metals or organic materials). They are such strong oxidizers that they are used to make fireworks. (Not in the concentrations in the soil though; at least the ground won’t explode.)\n\nHowever, perchlorates can also be a resource. The same high levels of oxygen that make them reactive make them a potential source of oxygen for breathing. There are bacteria on earth that ‘eat’ perchlorates, producing energy and oxygen. Colonists will use a bioreactor to purify soil and water and retrieve oxygen and biomass. It’s a solid win… as long as the perchlorates don’t get into anything!\n\n### Dust Storms\nAlthough the atmosphere on Mars is very very thin, the lower gravity and the fine particle size of Martian dust means that winds can raise clouds of dust, which then trap heat from the sun and make the air warmer, creating stronger winds. This can trigger a dust storm.\n\nSmaller dust storms lasting a few hours or days are common. Occasionally much larger storms develop (pretty much yearly near the equator). Sometimes these merge into truly enormous storms that can blanket the entire planet for months. These major dust storms seem to only happen in the southern spring and summer (northern autumn and winter).\n\nThe atmosphere is too thin to do much harm by itself, but the blown dust can build up on, or bury, equipment or roads, scour and erode surfaces, and of course get into everything. \n\nFurther, the dust blocks the light, greatly reducing the energy from solar panels or the light needed to grow plants – potentially for many months. If robust alternative power sources are not available, a major dust storm could cripple or even destroy the colony. \n\nDust storms can also accumulate a fairly high static charge. These potentials will probably not build up to create lightning discharges like the ones on Earth, but such a static storm could still be dangerous to electronics and computer systems. These must be checked and properly grounded and/or shut down.\nMechanical Failures\nStuff breaks. Stuff that gets really cold (then warmer… then really cold…) breaks a lot. Stuff that’s corroded by perchlorates breaks a lot. Stuff that’s used all the time because it's essential to life breaks, too!\n\nPreventing and rapidly responding to mechanical failures is a constant necessity for the astronauts. From time to time things will break without warning and require immediate repair. \n\n### Air\nWe talk about “the Martian atmosphere”, and it’s easy to think of it as like Earth’s. But on Earth the Martian atmosphere would be considered a pretty good vacuum. Our air has a density of about 1kg/m3, but the atmosphere on Mars has a density of about 20g/m3 – about 2%. For our astronauts, stepping outside is like being on the moon… you need your spacesuit, and you need to be very very careful that the spacesuit stays intact and you have adequate air.\n\nAir supplies (for space suits and for buildings) are essential to life, but they can be fragile, too.\nAir lines can leak or crack, or freeze up (especially if there has been extreme cold).\n\nThe air mixture must be monitored carefully. Colonists on Mars will need to make their own air from oxygen combined with nitrogen and argon found in the Martian atmosphere. If the oxygen level is too high or too low very bad things can happen. Because mental clarity is the first thing affected by getting too much or too little oxygen, astronauts may not realize there is an issue until too late. There is also a risk of carbon monoxide contamination as well, since this is also found in the Martian atmosphere and could contaminate the nitrogen/argon. And it only takes a little…\n\n\n### The Bends\nWe associate “the bends” with deep sea diving, where divers surfacing too quickly can get nitrogen bubbles in the blood, a very painful and dangerous condition. \n\nNobody is deep sea diving on Mars, but any sudden drop in pressure can cause this same effect, and using an airlock is a sudden drop in pressure. Astronauts risk decompression sickness. Although the suits have some pressure there will be still be pressure changes associated with using them and it will be important not to pass through the airlock too quickly. At least some time will be needed to adjust. Even if this is done carefully, there is the chance of minor but cumulative effects. \n\nUsing argon as well as nitrogen in the air mixture actually helps with this - and we want to use argon, because there is almost as much argon as nitrogen in the Martian atmosphere. But astronauts will need to try to avoid going in and out too often, cannot rush the process, and will also need to be monitored to make sure damage (including to the brain and lungs) does not accumulate.\n\nIf you imagine a scenario in which an astronaut is injured while working outside the colony, or a vital piece of equipment breaks, you can see how hard it will be for astronauts to force themselves to go slowly through the airlocks, even though they are urgently needed elsewhere.\n\nThis is a strong reason to want most colony buildings linked by a pressurized set of tunnels, so you don’t have to go through an airlock, wait to decompress, exit into the perchlorate dust, and back through another airlock (and shower etc.) each time you want to move from a hab to a social hall, workshop, or lab. \n\n### Radiation\nWithout an atmosphere or magnetic field, the surface of Mars receives a much greater amount of radiation from space, both in cosmic rays (very high energy particles which originate outside the solar system) and in particles from the Sun. Over time, interactions with outside radiation causes secondary radioactivity in the upper layers of the soil as well. This is all discussed in greater detail in the radiation section.\n\nTo protect against radiation exposure, Mars will require new construction methods and materials. Best practice would require removing the top layer of regolith before building,and then including radiation shielding for every structure. They will especially need to be careful about how much total time they spend outside the shielded areas of the habitats.\n\nA related but very serious radiation issue that could affect the astronauts is an event known as a Coronal Mass Ejection, or CME – an unusually energetic release of material from the Sun. This could create a massive flux of radiation with only hours of warning. Hardening equipment against damage and retreating to the equivalent of a hurricane or tornado shelter would be the only course of action. It would be extremely dangerous to get caught out on a surveying expedition during such an event!\n\nRead about the Carrington Event if you want to see how serious an event like this was on the very much better protected Earth. \n\n(General: Ancient Superflare Suggests Risks for Mars Missions Technical: The magnitude and effects of extreme solar particle events)\n\n### Psychological and Interpersonal Conflict\nThe experience of explorers, and those establishing colonies far from other people, has shown how important a wide range of social contacts is to our mental health. On Earth you can (usually) get away from people when they annoy you (family can be an exception!) but when there is literally nowhere else to go, conflicts can escalate quickly. Being far from all other humans and unable to escape (as well as high levels of stress and the need to work very hard indeed) will take its toll on the mental well-being of the astronauts. \n\nThere have been fist fights on space stations already, and it is quite possible that mental health and resolving interpersonal conflict will be as important as engineering to the success of the colony.\n\nThese events, on their own or triggered by outside factors such as dust storms or the screeching winds of a dust storm, will need to be monitored carefully and handled deftly by the colony’s leadership – with all astronauts’ support and awareness of the importance of well-being to everyone’s success.\n\nSee also Effects of isolation and confinement on humans-implications for manned space explorations\n\n### Disease\n\n#### Human\nDisease is another possible hazard for a colony on Mars, where people will be required to live in close proximity to one another, using heavily recycled air and water … all while placing them under environmental and psychological stresses that will impact their immune systems. \n\nA disease could break out within the colony, whether something normally benign that gets out of control, an illness brought from Earth, or a mutation within the normal bacteria present in the colony and colonists. (Radiation both impairs the human immune system and increases genetic mutation rates.) Once established, an outbreak would be difficult to contain and could seriously affect the colony.\n\nIn the event of an illness, some attempt to quarantine part of the colony might be needed.\n#### Plant\nDiseases affect plants as well as people. Crop blight could decimate the plants the colony will depend on for food and air.\n\nKeeping greenhouses isolated from one another is key, along with the aggressive treatment of any disease. The colony will need to keep sufficient reserves of food, oxygen, and seeds in case an entire greenhouse is lost and needs to restart from scratch.\n\n### The Unknown\nWhenever humans have ventured into new environments they have discovered that something we took for granted is actually essential (think of sailors and settlers developing vitamin deficiency diseases such as scurvy, rickets, and beri-beri, for example!)\n\nIt is almost certain that some of the hazards of living on Mars cannot be anticipated. We will learn about them only once we are there.\n\nFortunately, humanity is a resilient and innovative species. Problems will be solved, and people will thrive.\n",

It is not designed to be air-tight or pressurized - just a shed to store tools, materials, and equipment that do not require special storage conditions, but require some protection against radiation and dust. The walls of the building also serve to moderate temperature changes so equipment inside does not experience the extreme changes of Mars’ day/night cycle. \n\nNext to the building there is an open storage area where large items and equipment can be stored which do not need these protections.\n\nSmall storage buildings are used as a location to store various goods and equipment, which requires it to be kept safe from the Martian elements, especially the dust. Though it does not require a large amount of power to maintain the building atmosphere, it does require power for lighting and any additional energy that may be needed within the building, for using or charging equipment.\n\nAstronauts need to keep an inventory of the equipment in the building, as well as detailed records of what has been used, removed or worked on.\n\nThis building does not have a specific resource output, however it is utilized to convert power and labor logistics resources into Martia.\n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"small_storage_building\"  keys=\"ssb-C,ssb-B\"></ItemInGame>",

Though there is not a need for power towards heating or pressurization, these structures need to be well illuminated and all tools must have the energy they require to operate.\n\nA large amount of work that is carried out within these maintenance buildings centers around maintaining regular logs of the equipment that is served within.

Often if there is not a pressing need for a specific repair, the engineers will perform preventative maintenance on the equipment stores within to ensure that nothing escapes their focus.\n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"small_maintenance_building\"  keys=\"smb-A,smb-C,smb-D\"></ItemInGame>",

Made with composite reinforced heat-insulating panels, this tank has the properties of a thermos. An electric heating element and a circulation pump keep the water from freezing.\n\nAlthough it is described as “low pressure,” the tank must also be pressurized enough to keep the boiling point of water below the temperature at which it is liquid. About 8 000 Pa of pressure (1/12th of an atmosphere) is needed to raise the boiling point above any foreseeable temperature ([Source](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/water-evacuation-pressure-temperature-d_1686.html)).\n\n## Dimensions\nThe volume of one tank is 45 cubic meters. (45 tonnes). The Low-Pressure Tank needs enough heat and pressure to keep the water inside from freezing. The Low-Pressure Tank processes large quantities of water per hour.\n\nThough this building does not have a specific unit of resource that is returned to the colonists, the low-pressure tank does convert power and water to martia. \n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"low-pressure_tank\"  keys=\"lpt-B,lpt-C\"></ItemInGame>\n",

With the limited space of the social hub, there might be interesting adaptations of games like ping pong or other sports that require less space.\n\n#### VR gaming\nVR technology could allow colonists to participate in a wide range of sports that might not be feasible in the physical environment. Virtual sports tournaments and competitions could become a popular pastime.\n\n#### Board games and card games\nTraditional board games, card games, and strategy games can provide entertainment and mental stimulation.\n\n#### Simulation games\nGiven the technical nature of a Mars colony, simulation games that mimic real-life scenarios could be both entertaining and educational. Games that involve managing resources, solving problems, and making strategic decisions could be popular.\n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"inflatable_social_hub\"  keys=\"inflatable-social-hub-power-required,inflatable-social-hub-labor-social-labor,inflatable-social-hub-food-requirement,inflatable-social-hub-total-wellbeing-hour\"></ItemInGame>\n\n*Please note that hazards and repair are currently being revised and further developed so this information will probably be clarified and expanded.*\n",

The greenhouse building consists of two parts- a technical area and area for cultivation.These greenhouses are the primary location in which life-sustaining produce are grown for the colony.\n\nThese greenhouses are 17 m x 85 m and stands at 12.25 m tall. Allowing for the technical area and support equipment about 15 m x 64 m = 960 m2 is available for cultivation.\n\nThe greenhouses must maintain a consistent temperature to ensure that the plant-life within is able to survive and thrive. The greenhouse must also supplement Mars’ sunlight with electrical lighting. All of this requires large amounts of energy to ensure the ideal growing conditions for the crops.\n\nThe heating needed for the greenhouse is found from the dimensions of the building and the rate of heat loss through its materials.\n\nThe printed area of the greenhouse floor is a slab of printed marscrete and insulation with an area of 17m x 85.3m = 1450 m2. At about 5.6 W/m2 this is an energy cost of 8221 W.\n\nThe printed portion of the greenhouse, which houses the equipment and labs, has a surface area of 1017 m2 and loses 5.6 W/m2 adding another 5695 W of heating cost.\nFinally the glass and ice roof of the green house itself has an area of 3,056 m2 and loses heat more quickly being thinner and more conductive (as well as radiating heat more easily), which gives it a heat loss of 10 W/m2 = 30,555 W.\n\nIn addition to the energy needed to keep the greenhouse warm, energy is needed for light (as Earth plants have not evolved for the fainter light of Mars, and as dust storms can greatly reduce the incoming light for months at a time). \nThe growing area of the greenhouse is 960 m2 as previously shown, and 30W/m2 are needed on average to supplement the natural light and maintain other systems, giving 960m2 x 30 W/m2 = 28800 W.\n\nWater usage is vital for the survival of the plants within the greenhouse and for maintaining its efficacy in growing at an optimal rate.\n\nPlants require 5.7 g of water for each kiloCalorie of food produced. As we will see shortly the estimated production of the greenhouse is 39 360 kCal / day, therefore needing 225 kg of water each day (225L).\n\nFor the greenhouse to operate at its highest efficacy, the brilliant scientific minds are on hand. These scientists facilitate the planting, growth and harvest cycles, while also monitoring for potential defects in the produce.\n\nThe day to day operation of the greenhouses in the colony are an imperative part of their operation, ensuring that the technical work is facilitated properly to support the scientific work being done by the botanists working in the greenhouse.\n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"greenhouse\"  keys=\"gh-food-production,gh-total-labor-per-hour,gh-o2-production,gh-total-power-required,gh-water-required\"></ItemInGame>",

The average temperature on Mars is about -60 °C (compared to +15 °C) for Earth.\n\nMaintaining a livable temperature is one of the major energy costs for the buildings (and even some of the electronics!) in the colony.\n\nObjects lose heat to the environment by three main processes: \n\n1. Convection\n2. Conduction \n3. Radiation \n\n#### Convection\nInterestingly, convection is a much greater problem on Earth than Mars! Because the Martian atmosphere is very thin it does not carry away heat the way cold air would on Earth. \n\n#### Conduction\nFor our purposes, this is the heat drawn off by touching the icy ground.\n\n#### Radiation\nThe heat we throw off. On Mars we radiate heat much more because of the very cold background. \n\n-----\n\n### Insulation\nThe key to reducing heat loss is insulation: using materials in our walls and floors that slows the rate at which heat escapes. The harder it is for heat to pass through a material, the better an insulator it is. \n\nThis is described by what is called an R-value (RVal), which combines:\nhow easily heat passes through a material (its “thermal conductivity”, k) \nand the thickness of the material (t). \n\nThen RVal = t/k.\n\nTo use an example from Earth construction, a pane of window glass (which is thin and made of something that is not a great insulator) has an RVal of about 0.25 m2K/W. In comparison, a 10cm insulating panel (which is thick and made of foam) might have an RVall over 5.0 m2K/W\n\nOn Mars Colony there are two main types of building: \n\n1. Inflatable structures shipped out from Earth. These are made from shell membranes that are then filled with water (which freezes into ice) and covered with insulation.\n2. Rigid buildings made from [marscrete](/technology/manufactured-resources/marscrete), 3D printed on site and then covered with insulation.\n\nMaterials Assumed\n\n| Insulation Material | thermal conductivity k (W/mK) |  |\n| - | - | - |\n| marscrete | 0.27 | (assume sulfur) |\n| insulation | 0.015| (assume similar to aerogels)|\n| ice | 2.5 | (2.2 @0C to 3.5 at -100C) |\n\nInflatable structures have walls made of water ice (to protect against radiation) and a special aerogel-like insulator. They are also covered on the outside with a material that reduces their radiative heat loss (low emissivity). When layers of insulation are used their R-values add, so these structures can be summarized as:\n\n\n| Component | R-value (m2 K / W) | Emissivity |\n| - | - | - |\n| 10 cm insulation | 6.67 | Not relevant |\n| 20 cm water (ice) | 0.08 | Not relevant |\n| Shell membrane | Assumed negligible | 0.08 |\n| total | 6.75 | 0.08 |\n\n3D Printed structures, however, are more robust. They combine structural Martian Concrete (a better insulator) with the high quality insulation. They are also thicker!\n\n| Component | R-value (m2 K / W) | Emissivity |\n| - | - | - |\n| Outer shell | Assumed negligible | 0.08 |\n| 15 cm insulation |  12.50  | Not relevant |\n| 35 cm sulfur concrete | 1.30 | Not relevant |\n| total | 13.80 | 0.08 |\n\n-----\n### Determining Heat Loss\n#### Conduction\nOnce we know the RVal we can find the heat loss. For conduction (such as a floor which is in contact with the cold ground) this is fairly straight-foward!\nHeat loss due to conduction depends on the temperature difference and the R_val:\ndQ/dtA = T/Rval= (Tint-Text)RVal\n\n <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/Heating_Buildings_Figures_1_7af807815d.png\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAFCAIAAADzBuo/AAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAAoElEQVR4nGP4////ldkbW+KWvnj/8f+/f9++ffsBBt+/ffv37x/D////11kkyTCE3X397tb1q0ePHj1y5Mjx48evX7v+989fkPR2tyQnhuAbz19fvHBu586dp06eunz5yrt376C6N9vmiDFkPv38/eqVK4cOHTp69OjJkyfPnz//+fNnkPTxtVvnd675+///79+/Ibb++PHjz58/////BwBlgnoI/8lrwAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"></ImageWithBlur> \n\n\nThe temperature inside should be a comfortable living temperature, which we take to be 20°C, and the temperature outside (the ground) with an average temperature of -60°C. For a floor made from Marscrete and insulation the effective R=value is 14.4 m2K/W, giving a rate of heat loss of 20°C - -60°C13.3 m² K/W = 5.4 W/m2\n\nThis value (with some modification for the inflatable buildings) is used to calculate heat loss to the ground. Heat loss from the walls and roof is a bit more complex.\n\n#### Conduction and Radiation\nFor a building on Earth a lot of the heat loss is to the air, but on Mars our buildings are surrounded by atmosphere so thin as to be basically a vacuum. A perfect vacuum would be a perfect insulator, so there is very little loss by conduction.\nMost heat loss from the walls and ceilings of buildings is therefore by radiation into the cold outside environment. There are therefore two parts to heat loss from walls and roofs. Heat from the inside of the wall travels to the outside of the wall by conduction, and the heat leaves the outside wall by radiation:\n\n <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/Heating_Buildings_Figures_2_9cef5c3c00.png\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAECAIAAAA4WjmaAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAAh0lEQVR4nAF8AIP/AO/e5KmOsvb1793d3MXFxdLS0szMzMfHx8LCwuLi4gDQm6UwAD3q69/b19W4ubm8vLy+vr7ExMS/v7/i4uIA16CtNwBE8PDk1NHNrq6vt7e3x8fHzMzMzc3N9PT0AOjc366btv///+np6NfX1+Dg4PLy8vDw8PLy8v39/UV9XuYl8fXDAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\"></ImageWithBlur> \n\nThe Stephan-Boltzmann law says that the rate of heat flow depends on the fourth power of the temperature! \nradiated dQ/dtA=(Text4)\nHere  is the emissivity,  the Steffan-Bolzmann constant (5.67x10-8 W/m2K4) and Text is the temperature of the radiating surface.\n\nBut the environment is also radiating, so while some energy leaves, some energy also arrives depending on the temperature of the environment Tenv. We take this to be -100°C, a rough estimate based on a compromise between sky temperature and the ground.  \n\nThe difference of the incoming and outgoing heat flow that determines the radiated energy:\nradiated dQ/dtA=(Text4-Tenv4)\nSo heat arrives at the outside of the wall due to conduction:  conduction dQ/dtA = Tint-TextRval\nIf more heat arrives than leaves the temperature of the outside wall increases and conduction falls while the rate heat is radiated increases unit heat is leaving as fast as it arrives. Conversely if more heat leaves than arrives then the temperature of the outside wall will drop, causing more conduction and less radiation until a balance is reached.\n\nThus a stable temperature is reached when the rate of conduction and the rate of radiation are equal, which can be found by finding the temperature of the outside wall where:\ndQ/dtA=Tint-TextRval= (Text4-Tenv4).\n\nUsing the values stated for Marscrete with high albedo coating this equilibrium is reached with Text = -57.5°C and a rate of heat loss of 5.6 W/m2 \n\nA similar calculation for inflatable buildings gives a rate of loss of 10.2 W/m2 for these structures.\n\n",

The pump heats up the ice until a spherical reservoir forms inside the ice-region. Water can then be pumped to the surface, filtered and stored (See [Water](/mars/natural-resources/water)).\n\nThe Ice Mining Rig requires an enormous amount of power to successfully operate its deep drills, pumps and (especially) heating mechanisms to retrieve water from beneath the surface of Mars. \n\n## Melting Subsurface Ice\nAlthough it is tempting to imagine this as drilling into a glacier (and that could work!) in most cases the ice will be in the gaps between rocks and pebbles etc. (permafrost) and that works fine. This is why drilling is important. The heat will produce both liquid and gas, though the higher pressure underground will keep things mostly liquid. To ensure that the water is in a form that can be pumped, pressure will have to be maintained at the drill head.\n\nThe process of melting ice is energy intensive, all the more since the ground is very cold.\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"ice_mining_rig\" keys=\"ice-melting-required-energy\"></ItemCalculations>\n\nAdditional energy will be needed to offset heat losses to the cold environment, depending on the composition of the rock etc. This adds a ‘maintenance cost’ to keeping the rig running. Shutting it down will need to be done carefully, however, to avoid freezing causing damage to the equipment.\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"ice_mining_rig\" keys=\"ice-mining-rig-energy-to-melt-ice\"></ItemCalculations>\n\nFor an in-depth technical discussion on the power required, see [Making Water](/technology/manufactured-resources/making-water).  \n\n## Purification and Tank Corrosion Prevention\nWater obtained by the Ice Mining Rig may have significant amounts of [perchlorate contamination](/mars/the-planet/environmental-hazards) (in fact some water in the ground may be already liquid if it contains a lot of perchlorates!) Therefore, collected water will need to be purified before being used (and the inside of the tank treated to prevent corrosion).\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"ice_mining_rig\" keys=\"ice-mining-rig-energy-to-fill-tank\"></ItemCalculations>\n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"ice_mining_rig\"  keys=\"ice-mining-rig-energy-input-hour,ice-mining-rig-water-hour-output\"></ItemInGame>",

It features a lightweight tilting mechanism to optimize efficiency and an electrostatic coating to help keep dust from collecting on top of the cells.\n\n## Solar Flux on Mars\n\nMars is much further from the Sun than the Earth, and the Sun is correspondingly less bright. When it reaches Earth, the solar flux (amount of energy arriving per square metre) is roughly 1373W/m2. But by the time that sunshine reaches Mars, the solar flux is only 590W/m2.\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"solar_panel_array\" keys=\"solar-constant-mars-equator\"></ItemCalculations>\n\n## Panel Surface Area\n\nThe array contains 6 panels with each panel being 4 meters long and 2.5 meters high, for a total area of 60 meters squared:\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"solar_panel_array\" keys=\"solar-panel-array-area\"></ItemCalculations>\n\n## Power Efficiency\n\nA further effect is the efficiency of the solar panels. Not all the energy in sunlight can be converted to electrical power, and the more efficient the panel is the more expensive. We have assumed solar panels with a 45% efficiency, which is actually quite high and reflects the developments and improvements the ISA has achieved with this technology.\n\nMaximum energy output can be calculated as follows:\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"solar_panel_array\" keys=\"solar-panel-array-equator-output\"></ItemCalculations>\n\n## Location of Colony\n\nThere are several factors that will reduce this amount significantly.\n\nThe first is the latitude of the panels. [Our colony is located near the equator](/mars/the-planet/location) so the effect is small, but at higher latitudes this effect will become significant. Here are the current estimates we use (with some allowance for rounding):\n\n <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/Solar_Panel_array_Figures_ee4fd22d15.png\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAxUlEQVR4nAG6AEX/APX08fX08f7+/ZGHhGxgXbStrfT09L6+vmlhXdbV1QDOyrzq6OLNyMRqXFqUlZmlp6rExcaCeHhUS0zR0tMA5eLe9vb0gnVu39va/P396urr5ufnrqqqvL2+1NTVAP///////8jFxr6+wN7e3sTGyNLS1f////X19vX19gD+/v319PExLCgAAACFenqBhIZtbW2KiomKioqfn58A9/b2////LSUgGAIA2tjZgYGBUVFRUVFRY2Njqamp/RV8IDFMMIAAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"></ImageWithBlur> \n\nThis only reduces the maximum total for our current colony by a few percent:\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"solar_panel_array\" keys=\"solar-panel-array-main-colony-output\"></ItemCalculations>\n\n## Day/Night Cycle\nOf course the best solar panel only generates output half the time… at night there isn’t much light for a panel to work with! \n\nAlthough our panels follow the sun to maximize the energy received, they also are less effective in the early morning and late afternoon (we assume half as efficient during the first and last 90min of the day), so that the effective day for output is shortened to 10.5 hours:\n\n<ItemCalculations itemType=\"solar_panel_array\" keys=\"sunlight-hours-a-day\"></ItemCalculations>\n\n<ItemInGame itemType=\"solar_panel_array\"  keys=\"solar-panel-array-avg-energy-output\"></ItemInGame>",

There are several types of research that can generate valuable data:\n\n- exploratory research\n- formal experimental research\n- implementation research\n- operations data collection and analysis\n\n### Exploratory Research\nGathers and analyzes data from Martian exploration. \n\nExamples include \n\n- analysis of regolith samples from a new region of an ancient Martian lake bed\n- measurements of a newly discovered lava tube\n- analysis of ores from a recent meteor strike.\n- \n### Formal Experimental Research \nTargets a testable hypothesis and involves experimental design. \nExamples include:\n\n- a [Bayesian ](https://www.britannica.com/science/Bayesian-analysis)study of the environmental risk assessment for surveying and mining operations\n- a study of protective treatment on impact of extravehicular activities on eye health\n- a study of wintertime crop growth with different soil microbial amendments.\n\n### Implementation Research \nIncludes a wide range of activities. Classic implementation research is the analysis of the formal introduction of a developed process to production. This yields critical information about the newly introduced process and any adjustments that must be made. At the other extreme of implementation research, crew members may tinker with new or existing technologies in new combinations, producing insights. \n\nExamples of implementation research include:\n\n- analyses of an implementation of a new ore-refining process on the path to production\n- satisfaction surveys on new crew menus\n- tinkering with the combinations of sensors on autonomous surface robots employing machine learning.\n\n### Operations Data Collection and Analysis \nEven the most routine activities on Mars generate data and are subject to analysis. These types of analyses support decision-making during planning and may reveal issues or opportunities that were not originally anticipated. \n\nExamples include:\n\n- analysis of human waste for changes in seasonal hormone levels\n- analysis of the effectiveness of ice-mining with temperature variations\n- collecting vehicle sensor data for real, as opposed to ideal, speeds over various kinds of terrain\n- analysis of Earth media for interest in Martian products.\n",

Humans are critically dependent on water, and the use of Ice Mining Rigs to supply water on Mars will be an absolute necessity for sustaining a colony on the Red Planet.\n\nBut you might be surprised just how much power is required to do ice-mining at the scale the colony requires.\n### Calculations\nHeating and melting the ice from approximately -80 °C to 0 °C (using a mid temperature range for heat capacity of ice) requires:\n\n***E/m= c T = 1 kg (1800 J/kg °C) (80 °C) = 144000 J/kg***\n\nPlus we need additional energy to heat the matrix around the ice (assumed to be ~2.2 kg/kg water based on data from [Materials weight and volume, sands](https://www.aqua-calc.com/calculate/volume-to-weight) and regolith data from [Thermal Conductivity and Specific Heat of the Mojave Mars Regolith](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1440.pdf).\n\n***E/m= c T = 2.2 kg (550 J/kg °C) (80 °C) = 88000 J/kg***\n\nMelting the ice also requires supplying the latent heat of fusion for ice, which is\n**E/m= L = 334000 J/kg**\n\nThis gives a total energy of** 566 000 J/kg of water, or 157 Wh/kg.**\n\nThe exact amount of energy used in operation is dependent on the efficiency of the equipment and the rate at which water is extracted. For the large Ice Mining Plant the efficiency is higher as is the rate of production, with actual energy costs of 186 Wh/kg, while for the smaller but more flexible Ice Mining Rig both efficiency and rate of production is significantly lower.\n\n| Item | Efficiency | Energy Use | Water Output | Total Energy Used |\n| - | - | - | - | - |\n| Ice Mining Rig | ~55% | 280 Wh/kg | 69 L/hr | 19 370 Wh/h |\n| Ice Mining Plant | ~85% | 186 Wh/kg | 1 040 L/hr | 193 670 Wh/h |",

As there’s a lot more physical movement and labor to be done on Mars, to be safe we will assume that a working adult needs to breathe 1 kg of oxygen per day.\n- The original BIOS 3 experiments concluded that to supply complete food and oxygen for one person requires 56 square meters of plants. (You can grow plants that will make oxygen more efficiently, but the main function of our greenhouses is to grow food and scrub carbon dioxide!)\n- Each square meter of plants can supply 0.017 kg of oxygen / day.\n\n____\n\n1 m2 of growing space, of medium-sized plants, produces roughly 4 liters of oxygen per day.\n\nA small [Inflatable Greenhouse](/technology/buildings/inflatable-greenhouse), with 80m2 of growing space produces 12g of Oxygen per hour. This is after factoring in an efficiency rating of 75% (this represents times when the crops are still growing and thus smaller and thus produce less oxygen - the smaller the greenhouse the lower the efficiency due to a higher percentage of the crops being ready to harvest at the same time)\n\nA medium [Greenhouse](/technology/buildings/greenhouse), with 960m2 of growing space, and an efficiency of 85% produces 163.2g of oxygen per hour\n\nA large Crop Facility, with 3840 m2 of growing space, and efficiency of 95%, produces 729.6g of oxygen per hour\n\n### Electrolysis\nBasically by running an electrical current through the water we break the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen, producing hydrogen gas at one electrode and oxygen at the other:\n\t\t\n> ***2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2***\n\nThis requires 286 kJ/mol of water used, or about 5 kWh/kg of O2 (from 1.125 kg of water).\n\n### Fuel Production\nOxygen is also produced in the [Fuel Plant](/technology/equipment/fuel-plant) while creating methane. Using methane as fuel requires oxygen as well. However, for best efficiency the rocket actually uses slightly less oxygen than one would expect from the chemistry alone (3.5 kg O2 / 1.0 kg of methane, not 4.0kg as complete combustion would require), so there is an excess of 0.5 kg of spare oxygen per kg of fuel produced.\n\n\n### Perchlorates\nPoisonous and corrosive, the perchlorates mixed into Martian regolith and dust will be one of the biggest challenges for the Mars Colony. \n\nOne promising method for dealing with them involves bacteria that reduce perchlorates as their source of energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n> ***ClO4-  → Cl- + 2 O2***\n\t\t\n#### Make It Better\n[This article](https://www.ehn.org/scientists-are-using-bacteria-to-remove-harmful-contaminants-from-our-water-heres-how-2625517276.html) describes some research on using bacteria to eliminate perchlorates. Choosing the right bacteria and designing such a system for the Mars Colony would be a terrific research project for our community!\n\n###Refining\nFor example, hematite is an iron ore abundant on Mars (including in the ubiquitous dust!). \n> ***2 Fe2O3  → 4 Fe + 3 O2***\n\n1 kg of hematite will release about 300g of oxygen (and 700g of iron).\n\n###Further Reading\n####MOXIE \n[[Mars Oxygen In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Experiment](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/)] \nIn 2022, this experiment carried out by the Perseverance rover demonstrated that carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere could be directly  electrolysed to produce oxygen.\n\n> ***2CO2 → 2CO + O2**\n\nThe advantage of this process is that it produces O2 anywhere on Mars with no need for water. It requires a lot of energy, however (at least as much as hydrolysis) and much more complex equipment. It remains to be seen if such a process will be required or desirable.",

There is a well understood reaction for this, called the [Sabatier process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction).\n\nThe fuel plant produces hydrogen by electrolysis of water:\n\n> *** 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2***\n\nThen reacts the hydrogen with CO2 from the atmosphere using a catalyst:\n\n> \t***4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2 H2O***\n\nThe water produced is reused (with additional new water) in step 1 again. This results in a overall reaction of:\n\t\n\n> ***2 H2O + CO2 → CH4 + O2***\n\nThis is the reverse of the combustion reaction for methane… essentially we are “unburning” carbon dioxide and storing energy.\n\nEnergy costs for this reaction are high.\n\n- Step 1 requires about 281.8 kJ/mol of hydrogen produced. \n- Step 2 requires 165.0 kJ/mol per mol of methane.\n\nThis gives a total energy cost of \n\n- 4(281.8 kJ) + 165.0 = 1 292 kJ/mol of methane, or 22.4 kWh per tonne of methane. \n\nIt takes over **200 tonnes of methane** to fully fuel a spaceship, so that’s rather a lot.\n\nHowever there is even more energy needed, because the Sabatier process requires the CO2 to be compressed and hot, while the CO2 in the Martian atmosphere is very cold and very very thin. Gathering and compressing the CO2 takes a great deal of energy… the equations of thermodynamics allow us to calculate this using the [adiabatic compression of a triatomic gas](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_II_-_Thermodynamics_Electricity_and_Magnetism_(OpenStax)/03%3A_The_First_Law_of_Thermodynamics/3.07%3A_Adiabatic_Processes_for_an_Ideal_Gas):\n\n <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/makingfuel1_355302b46c.png\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAACCAIAAADuA9qHAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAOklEQVR4nCXGwQAAMAwEwYpEohQBOJgIRGA54nE8Meijr5kD2M7Mn6oCdre7Z+Z8IqK7gXuvJNuSgAckcCA7xvQ5/wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"></ImageWithBlur> \n\nWhere: \t\n\n- γ in theory is 5/3 for a triatomic gas such as CO2, but experiments show at these temperatures γ is [changeable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_(data_page)#cite_ref-lange1525_8-0). We will use an average value over the temperature range of 1.3, recognising this is an approximation.\n- Pi (for Mars atmosphere) is about 800 Pa (see [Atmosphere](/mars/the-planet/atmosphere)) \n- Vi for the the 2.75 t of CO2 needed for a tonne of fuel at about 20g/m3 is 137500 m3\n- Pf = final pressure needed for the Sabatier process = 3✕106 Pa.\n- Thus, since pVγ is constant  <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/making_fuel_2_821a77227a.png\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAADCAIAAAAlXwkiAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAW0lEQVR4nDXBEQJAIQwA0C7QVbpTnudJFEWjSceIotFoBxjNoijq03/P3Xv33nNOZkZEAHi/c45LKdVaY4y991KKiOScvfchhNaaU1UiQsS11hjDzFSVmYnIzD6tOz8Ke0feMQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"></ImageWithBlur> \n\nUsing this in the previous equation gives 2.08✕109 J or 579 kWh per tonne of fuel produced, significantly above the chemical costs.\n\nThe total is then works out to close to 600 kWh per tonne of fuel produced. \n\nIn future more energy efficient methods of CO2 harvesting may be developed (possibly cryogenic methods) to reduce this high energy cost!\n\nIn summary: to produce one tonne of rocket fuel takes:\t\n\n- 2.75 t of compressed CO2 from the atmosphere\n- 2.25 t of water from ice mining\n- 600 kWh of energy (or more given that efficiency will be well below perfect!)\n\nThis produces \n\n- 1 t of methane\n- 4 t of oxygen. \n\nAs the maximum efficiency of combustion for lift is not quite complete burning, only 3.5 t of the oxygen will be needed for the spacecraft as oxidant, so for every tonne of fuel produced, 0.5 t of additional oxygen is available for other uses, such as making breathable air for our colonists.",

				"title": "Living in Low Gravity",
				"content": "Gravity is a measure of how fast an object accelerates toward the center of the planet. Gravity on Mars is much lower on Mars than on Earth ( (3.721 m/s2 vs Earth’s gravity 9.807 m/s2). The effects of low gravity on humans are two-fold:\n\n- direct biological effects of low gravity\n- indirect effects of low gravity on human activities\n\n### Direct Biological Effects\nGenerally, the moderately low gravity on Mars will result in changes in a number of important functions: \n\n- muscle bulk\n- bone thickness and density\n- inner ear function\n- blood pressure in different areas of the body\n- pressure within the sinus cavities of the head \n- pressure within the eyes\n- medical care\n\n#### Muscle tone\nHumans are able to stand upright because of a complicated symphony of leg and core muscle groups. Mars’ low gravity eats at this functionality. Muscle bulk loss may be countered by additional exercise.\n\n#### Bone thickness and density\nLike muscle bulk, human bones are use-it-or-lose-it. While not as dramatic as the bone loss experienced by astronauts in microgravity, astronauts on Mars will experience some bone loss. Exercise is the best remedy, especially exercise in artificial gravity.\n\n#### Inner Ear Function\nThe inner ear provides humans with our sense of movement and the position of our body relative to the ground. Astronauts new to Mars will be particularly vulnerable to vertigo (sense of spinning movement when still) and fear of falling. Positional exercises help relocate the inner ear bones and relieve these sensations.\n\n#### Regulating Pressure in the Body\nHuman bodies are adapted to counteract the effects of gravity on our water-based physiology. We are like a stacked column of connected water balloons. Without active work, gravity causes the upper balloons to lose fluid and pressure in favor of the lower ones. On Earth, humans do this active management of fluid automatically. \n\nOn Mars the effects of gravity on our bodies is moderated. The automatic active measures human bodies perform to drive fluid “up the column” will be more than needed, resulting in cold feet (less blood available in lower extremities), stuffed up heads (sinus cavities inflamed), and higher than desired pressure in the eyes. High blood pressure is a particular concern. Strokes are a risk. \n\nFortunately, human physiology adapts to the new level of gravity with some help of behavioral adjustments and medications. Behavioral adjustments might include Swinging Yoga where the astronaut dangles upside down from their feet and ankles and performs short stretch and strength routines throughout their day.\n\n#### Medical care\nCrushing injuries and other traumatic injuries are difficult to manage in microgravity because blood doesn’t drain away from the injury site in the way our bodies expect. Mars’ lower gravity does not cause as severe issues as microgravity, but for certain circumstances, time in artificial gravity is helpful.\n\nDuring pregnancy, there is concern that lower gravity may affect the womb environment and fetal development, making early spontaneous termination of pregnancy more likely. More information will be gathered as the colony becomes established. Gestating patients may spend time in artificial gravity environments to help development to stay on course.\n\n### Indirect Effects of Low Gravity on Activities\nLow gravity makes a lot of activities easier, such as lifting, tossing upward, bouncing and sliding. However, while the weight of objects (including human bodies) is lower on Mars because of the low gravity, the mass of objects is the same. In other words, if a human is shot, the mass and velocity of the bullet will do the same damage. \nThis has implications for capabilities and risks. \n\n### Capabilities\nHumans are able to lift much higher mass objects on Mars, but the work required to accelerate or decelerate the object horizontally will be the same. Striking a golf ball feels like the same effort (though the golf swing may feel strange due to the low weight of the club), but the ball goes a greater distance because gravity will pull it back to the ground more slowly. \n\nIf an astronaut is trying to push a high mass object horizontally, it feels somewhat harder to get traction to push effectively as traction is a function of gravity pressing the pusher into the ground. On the plus side, the object causes less friction itself. It is harder to get a good purchase on the ground and easier to jump upward.\n\nFor this reason, the natural human instinct to take advantage of the low gravity to do enthusiastic rock-hopping will tend to put more stress than astronauts expect on their muscles and tendons.\n\n### Driving and Vehicles\nSimilarly, the lower gravity reduces friction, making every outing in a quad bike or rover feel as if you are driving on ice. Because weight is lower, but mass is the same, hitting a bump will throw you much higher into the air … but hitting a wall will do just as much damage as on earth.\n\nFor wheeled loads, the weight of the object accelerating and decelerating horizontally feels higher than the weight of the object when lifted. Crushing injuries and damage to equipment are risks as astronauts tend to underestimate the force needed to slow or stop a heavy load moving horizontally. Injuries from misjudged jumps are also a risk. When driving a vehicle over irregular terrain, astronauts underestimate the ease with which vehicles become air-borne, resulting in injuries and damage.\n",

				"title": "Oxygen Consumption",
				"content": "### How much oxygen is needed for each astronaut every day? \nHumans require a minimum of 0.84 kg of oxygen daily, which at room temperature and Earth’s air pressure is 634 L. Allowing for building leakage, high astronaut activity and other contingencies, that is roughly 750 L per astronaut-day. \n\n### Why Earth’s air pressure?\nThe Colony could save on mechanical wear and tear of the habitations by maintaining the atmospheric pressure at lower than the 101 KPa of Earth. However, that would require a proportional increase in the amount of oxygen. When oxygen levels are proportionally high, the chance of fire and explosion is high. The choice was made to keep habitation atmospheric pressure at 101 kPa.\n\n### What if air pressure is too high?\nIf the air pressure is very high (greater than 1000 kPa, compared to 101 KPa on Earth at sea level), nitrogen enters the bloodstream and causes intoxication similar to alcohol intoxication. This is a danger on Earth in deep sea diving. On Mars, sensors monitor air pressure and maintain air pressure at a beneficial level.\n\n### What if there is not enough oxygen?\nSeveral methods of generating oxygen are operational in the Colony to decrease the chances of an oxygen shortage (See [Making Oxygen](/technology/manufactured-resources/making-oxygen)). It is still possible that astronauts on an EVA or in some isolated building may not have sufficient oxygen due to a breakdown. Sensors in the environment (EV suit, vehicle or building) warn the astronaut and trigger automated measures to alert the base and engage all available supplies.\n\nThe percent oxygen in breathable air is between 19 and 21% by volume under optimal conditions. If the astronaut is in a low oxygen environment (around 14%) for more than 3 minutes, they experience dizziness, drowsiness, poor visual acuity and loss of judgment. If less than 10%, unconsciousness and death follow. Low oxygen conditions that are survived may result in permanent brain and heart damage.\n\n### What if there is too much oxygen?\nSensors in EV suits, vehicles and buildings guard against excess oxygen concentrations. Pure oxygen is toxic to humans when administered for an extended time (over 24 hours). Symptoms include chest pain and coughing. Lungs may fill with fluid or collapse. Ironically, high oxygen concentrations result in an inability to take oxygen into the blood.\n\n### What about other gasses in the air?\nNitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and other trace gasses are present in the atmosphere that astronauts breathe. Nitrogen and argon compressed from the Martian atmosphere are relatively inert and are used to “fill” or keep the air pressure at a beneficial level. \n\nCarbon dioxide is produced when astronauts breathe. Carbon dioxide sensors in suits, vehicles and buildings monitor the build-up of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide scrubbers capture and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n",

Humans were not built for this environment, and astronauts need to be vigilant at all times. \n\n### Cold\nTemperatures on Mars vary wildly, reaching extreme cold temperatures of as low as -150 °C (at night at the poles) and as high as +20 °C (on the hottest part of a summer day on the equator). Average temperature on Mars is estimated at about -65 °C (average temperature for the Earth is about +15 °C).\n\nThe colony’s location is fairly tropical (about 12° South of the equator) and so comparatively warm. That still means an average temperature of about -50 °C, with lows below -60 and highs seldom going above 0 °C. \n\nAt the low end of this temperature range, material properties become different: rubber becomes like glass, metals are brittle, and lubricants don’t lubricate. During cold snaps bad things can happen:\n\n- Cracking or breaking of pipes or structures\n- Mechanical failures due to expansion and contraction\n- Mechanical failures due to seizing and wear\n- Battery output may drop to critical levels\n- Frostbite or worse if people are caught outside by any of these failures\n\nCold is the major issue with temperature, but warmth can be a problem, too. In areas where construction or mining has disturbed the surface, for example, a warm day can make ice in the soil vaporize and create sinkholes or dangerous instabilities. The sides of craters on Mars often show collapse due to this effect.\n### Dust\n <ImageWithBlur src=\"https://colonizemars-data-platform.b-cdn.net/Dust_588a0641bf.gif\" alt=\"\" blurData=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAAPoAAAD6AG1e1JrAAAAuklEQVR4nGP4//Ts/3eXrizvPzCz6f/1nf+Or/1/cfvddTOlxUXERQQZ/l/c+//Crv/ndnw4sun/k5v/7576f2HP/IbCgjCPt7vnM/y/cOTu8eNHNm+9cujQh+u3vz24d2DjtpuHDvx/evH/9UMM9mbGzZV1SybPO7pt26opk4+sW7d3wZzuusa6nMwkL1cGBgYGRgYGRyO9OG+3nOT4Wa31ekoyDAwMTExMIDlmJiZGEI0OmJiYmJmYAO5hV8KHffCjAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\"></ImageWithBlur> \n*Insight lander, at start and end of mission. The lander was eventually disabled by dust.*\n\nThe dust on Mars is powdery, jagged and abrasive, corrosive and loaded with poisonous perchlorates. It also carries electrostatic charge, so it clings to everything. Keeping dust out of machinery and people will be a major headache for the astronauts and a core consideration when designing buildings, vehicles, and tools.\n\nFor example, there will be some kind of shower in every airlock where people can pass into a building from the outside world. You will enter the lock from outside, shower in your space suit to remove dust, remove the space suit and leave it in the airlock, then proceed into the habitat. Something similar will have to be figured out for vehicles, or they will have to be kept in sealed environments, with their own airlocks and showers… Cleaning dust contamination will be a regular and essential chore.\n\nWhen dust gets into/onto equipment it will: \n\n- Destroy moving parts by abrasion\n- Destroy parts by corrosion/oxidation\n- Obscure visibility on windows and ruin air-tight seals on doors\n\n\nWhen dust gets into people they will develop \n\n- Irritation and sores,\n- coughs (and eventually tumors) from particles in the lungs\n- Thyroid poisoning\n\nAnd did we mention that the dust is [radioactive](/mars/the-planet/radiation)? \n### Perchlorates\nPerchlorates are chlorine compounds such as magnesium perchlorate, Mg(ClO4)2, and sodium perchlorate (NaClO4). They are what make the dust poisonous. On earth soil is considered contaminated and unsafe if the perchlorate concentration exceeds 55 thousandths of a gram per kg of soil (for residential areas). The ground on Mars is about 0.5 to 1 gram perchlorate per kg. That’s 10 or 20 times what is safe.\n\nThis is bad. Perchlorates are toxic (they mess up your thyroid gland) and corrosive (so they will eat away metals or organic materials). They are such strong oxidizers that they are used to make fireworks. (Not in the concentrations in the soil though; at least the ground won’t explode.)\n\nHowever, perchlorates can also be a resource. The same high levels of oxygen that make them reactive make them a potential source of oxygen for breathing. There are bacteria on earth that ‘eat’ perchlorates, producing energy and oxygen ([Source](https://www.ehn.org/scientists-are-using-bacteria-to-remove-harmful-contaminants-from-our-water-heres-how-2625517276.html)). Colonists will use a bioreactor to purify soil and water and retrieve oxygen and biomass. It’s a solid win… as long as the perchlorates don’t get into anything!\n### Dust Storms\nAlthough the atmosphere on Mars is very very thin, the lower gravity and the fine particle size of Martian dust means that winds can raise clouds of dust, which then trap heat from the sun and make the air warmer, creating stronger winds. This can trigger a dust storm.\n\nSmaller dust storms lasting a few hours or days are common. Occasionally much larger storms develop (pretty much yearly near the equator). Sometimes these merge into truly enormous storms that can blanket the entire planet for months. These major dust storms seem to only happen in the southern spring and summer (northern autumn and winter).\n\nThe atmosphere is too thin to do much harm by itself, but the blown dust can build up on, or bury, equipment or roads, scour and erode surfaces, and of course get into everything. \n\nFurther, the dust blocks the light, greatly reducing the energy from solar panels or the light needed to grow plants – potentially for many months. If robust alternative power sources are not available, a major dust storm could cripple or even destroy the colony. \n\nDust storms can also accumulate a fairly high static charge. These potentials will probably not build up to create lightning discharges like the ones on Earth, but such a ***static storm*** could still be dangerous to electronics and computer systems. These must be checked and properly grounded and/or shut down.\n### Mechanical Failures\nStuff breaks. Stuff that gets really cold (then warmer… then really cold…) breaks a lot. Stuff that’s corroded by perchlorates breaks a lot. Stuff that’s used all the time because it's essential to life breaks, too!\n\nPreventing and rapidly responding to mechanical failures is a constant necessity for the astronauts. From time to time things will break without warning and require immediate repair. \n### Air\nWe talk about “the Martian atmosphere”, and it’s easy to think of it as like Earth’s. But on Earth the Martian atmosphere would be considered a pretty good vacuum. Our air has a density of about 1kg/m3, but the atmosphere on Mars has a density of about 20g/m3 – about 2%. For our astronauts, stepping outside is like being on the moon… you need your spacesuit, and you need to be very very careful that the spacesuit stays intact and you have adequate air.\n\nAir supplies (for space suits and for buildings) are essential to life, but they can be fragile, too.\nAir lines can leak or crack, or freeze up (especially if there has been extreme cold).\n\nThe air mixture must be monitored carefully. Colonists on Mars will need to make their own air from oxygen combined with nitrogen and argon found in the Martian atmosphere. If the oxygen level is too high or too low very bad things can happen. Because mental clarity is the first thing affected by getting too much or too little oxygen, astronauts may not realize there is an issue until too late. There is also a risk of carbon monoxide contamination as well, since this is also found in the Martian atmosphere and could contaminate the nitrogen/argon. And it only takes a little…\n\n### The Bends\nWe associate “the bends” with deep sea diving, where divers surfacing too quickly can get nitrogen bubbles in the blood, a very painful and dangerous condition. \n\nNobody is deep sea diving on Mars, but any sudden drop in pressure can cause this same effect, and using an airlock is a sudden drop in pressure. Astronauts risk [decompression sickness](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/space-medicine/decomp.asp). Although the suits have some pressure there will be still be pressure changes associated with using them and it will be important not to pass through the airlock too quickly. At least some time will be needed to adjust. Even if this is done carefully, there is the chance of minor but cumulative effects. \n\nUsing argon as well as nitrogen in the air mixture actually helps with this - and we want to use argon, because there is almost as much argon as nitrogen in the Martian atmosphere. But astronauts will need to try to avoid going in and out too often, cannot rush the process, and will also need to be monitored to make sure damage (including to the brain and lungs) does not accumulate.\n\nIf you imagine a scenario in which an astronaut is injured while working outside the colony, or a vital piece of equipment breaks, you can see how hard it will be for astronauts to force themselves to go slowly through the airlocks, even though they are urgently needed elsewhere.\n\nThis is a strong reason to want most colony buildings linked by a pressurized set of tunnels, so you don’t have to go through an airlock, wait to decompress, exit into the perchlorate dust, and back through another airlock (and shower etc.) each time you want to move from a hab to a social hall, workshop, or lab. \n### Radiation\nWithout an atmosphere or magnetic field, the surface of Mars receives a much greater amount of radiation from space, both in cosmic rays (very high energy particles which originate outside the solar system) and in particles from the Sun. Over time, interactions with outside radiation causes secondary radioactivity in the upper layers of the soil as well. This is all discussed in greater detail in the [radiation](/mars/the-planet/radiation) section.\n\nTo protect against radiation exposure, Mars will require new construction methods and materials. Best practice would require removing the top layer of regolith before building,and then including radiation shielding for every structure. They will especially need to be careful about how much total time they spend outside the shielded areas of the habitats.\n\nA related but very serious radiation issue that could affect the astronauts is an event known as a Coronal Mass Ejection, or CME – an unusually energetic release of material from the Sun. This could create a massive flux of radiation with only hours of warning. Hardening equipment against damage and retreating to the equivalent of a hurricane or tornado shelter would be the only course of action. It would be extremely dangerous to get caught out on a surveying expedition during such an event!\n\nRead about the [Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event) if you want to see how serious an event like this was on the very much better protected Earth. \n\n(General: [Ancient Superflare Suggests Risks for Mars Missions](https://www.space.com/32942-solar-superflare-risks-for-mars-missions.html) Technical: [The magnitude and effects of extreme solar particle events](https://www.swsc-journal.org/articles/swsc/pdf/2014/01/swsc130038.pdf))\n\n### Psychological and Interpersonal Conflict\nThe experience of explorers, and those establishing colonies far from other people, has shown how important a wide range of social contacts is to our mental health. On Earth you can (usually) get away from people when they annoy you (family can be an exception!) but when there is literally nowhere else to go, conflicts can escalate quickly. Being far from all other humans and unable to escape (as well as high levels of stress and the need to work very hard indeed) will take its toll on the mental well-being of the astronauts. \n\nThere have been fist fights on space stations already, and it is quite possible that mental health and resolving interpersonal conflict will be as important as engineering to the success of the colony.\n\nThese events, on their own or triggered by outside factors such as dust storms or the screeching winds of a dust storm, will need to be monitored carefully and handled deftly by the colony’s leadership – with all astronauts’ support and awareness of the importance of well-being to everyone’s success.\n\nSee also[ Effects of isolation and confinement on humans-implications for manned space explorations](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/japplphysiol.00928.2015)\n### Disease\n#### Human\nDisease is another possible hazard for a colony on Mars, where people will be required to live in close proximity to one another, using heavily recycled air and water … all while placing them under environmental and psychological stresses that will impact their immune systems. \n\nA disease could break out within the colony, whether something normally benign that gets out of control, an illness brought from Earth, or a mutation within the normal bacteria present in the colony and colonists. (Radiation both impairs the human immune system and increases genetic mutation rates.) Once established, an outbreak would be difficult to contain and could seriously affect the colony.\n\nIn the event of an illness, some attempt to quarantine part of the colony might be needed.\n#### Plant\nDiseases affect plants as well as people. Crop blight could decimate the plants the colony will depend on for food and air.\n\nKeeping greenhouses isolated from one another is key, along with the aggressive treatment of any disease. The colony will need to keep sufficient reserves of food, oxygen, and seeds in case an entire greenhouse is lost and needs to restart from scratch.\n\n### The Unknown\nWhenever humans have ventured into new environments they have discovered that something we took for granted is actually essential (think of sailors and settlers developing vitamin deficiency diseases such as scurvy, rickets, and beri-beri, for example!)\n\nIt is almost certain that some of the hazards of living on Mars cannot be anticipated. We will learn about them only once we are there.\n\nFortunately, humanity is a resilient and innovative species. Problems will be solved, and people will thrive.\n\n----------\n\nPlease note that hazards and repair are currently being revised and further developed so this information will probably be clarified and expanded.\n",
